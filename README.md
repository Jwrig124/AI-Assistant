# Install Guide

You can clone the repo, or just download the zip directly. It's important to note that all files need to be kept in the same directory.

Once you have the files, all you need to do is provide your API keys within the code, and it's all set to run. You can also have the API keys read from file, similar to context.txt, if you'd prefer the API keys be outside of the code.

Feel free to edit the contex.txt to your liking, I just provided a solid template. You can have it set to pretty much anything, as long as it's within the guidelines of both OpenAI and Elevenlabs.
