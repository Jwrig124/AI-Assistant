# Install Guide

You can clone the repo, or just download the zip directly. It's important to note that all files need to be kept in the same directory.

Feel free to edit the contex.txt to your liking, I just provided a solid template. You can have it set to pretty much anything, as long as it's within the guidelines of both OpenAI and Elevenlabs.
